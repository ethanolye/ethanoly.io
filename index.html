<h1>Tom Scott</h1>

Born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, Scott first came to media attention as a student, creating a parody of a governmental website. He created his channel in 2006, but only began to enjoy mainstream popularity after 2014, when he began his education series "Things You Might Not Know". Scott produces and uploads educational videos to the channel across a range of topics including linguistics, technology, geography, history and science. His output has included series such as Language Files (which focuses on linguistics and languages), The Basics (computing and IT), Amazing Places (geographical locations), and Things You Might Not Know. Typically his videos take the form of relatively short videos on interesting items, with many having received external coverage, including colours unable to be recorded accurately on video,[3] compact hovercraft,[4] and how bear-resistant infrastructure is tested.[5]

Scott has also collaborated with other YouTubers.[6] He announced that he was taking a break from his YouTube work starting January 2024, after a decade of consistent weekly uploads.[7]

Early life
Thomas Scott[8][9][10] was born in 1984 or 1985[8][11] in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire,[8] and graduated from the University of York with a degree in linguistics and English language.[8][9] He later studied a two-year part-time research Master of Arts in educational studies.[12][13]

In 2003, Scott became the organiser of the British section of International Talk Like a Pirate Day.[14]

In 2004, when Scott was 19 and at university, he produced a website parodying the British government's "Preparing for Emergencies" website,[15] including a section explaining what to do in case of a zombie apocalypse. This resulted in the Cabinet Office demanding the site be deleted, to which Scott sent a "polite response declining to take down the site".[9][10][16]

Career
Political career

Scott as "Mad Cap'n Tom" in 2010
In 2008, he was nominated by his friends to run for student president at the University of York Students' Union, under the guise of his Talk Like a Pirate Day persona, "Mad Cap'n Tom Scott". Despite running as a joke, he gained almost 3,000 votes, won the election, and served as the organisation's 48th president.[14]

When running for Parliament in the Cities of London and Westminster constituency as a joke candidate in 2010, Scott used the character – at the time, he described his chances of winning in the safe Conservative seat of Westminster as "Somewhere 'twixt a snowball's chance in hell an' zero."[17] He received 84 votes (0.2% of the total), finishing in last place behind Pirate Party UK.[18]

Early career
In 2012 Scott was a presenter in the Sky 1 series Gadget Geeks alongside Colin Furze and Creative Technologist Charles Yarnold, where he was responsible for the creation of software solutions.[19] He also worked creating Flash games for the Daily Mirror's UsVsTh3m website. These included a viral "North-O-Meter" which judged its players' northernness.[20]

Scott received coverage in 2013 for "Actual Facebook Graph Searches", a Tumblr site which exposed a potentially embarrassing and dangerous collection of public Facebook data using Facebook's Graph Search, such as showing men in Tehran who have said that they were "interested in men" or "single women who live nearby and are interested in men and like getting drunk".[21]

YouTube career
Scott produces and uploads educational videos to the channel across a range of topics including linguistics, technology, geography, history and science. His work has included series including the languages and linguistics focused Language Files, computing and information technology based The Basics, Amazing Places, and Things You Might Not Know. Typically his videos take the form of relatively[vague] short videos on interesting items, with many having received external coverage[dubious – discuss] including colours unable to be recorded accurately on video,[3] compact hovercraft,[4] and how bear-resistant infrastructure is tested.[5] Scott has also collaborated with other YouTubers, including challenging YouTuber Jordan Harrod to create a deepfake version of him for $100.[6]

In 2022, Scott won the Streamy Award for Learning and Education.[22] He was nominated in the same category in 2023.[23]

Scott announced that he was taking a break from his YouTube work starting 1 January 2024, after a decade of consistent weekly uploads. "I am so tired. There's nothing in my life right now except work" he explained, although it was his "dream job". Scott believed YouTube made it impossible to reduce the quality of his videos. Thus he saw his only other option as expanding further and hiring staff, forcing him to "become a manager", which he deemed beyond his skills. Soon after, he noted that other YouTubers with similar long-form content were also reducing or stepping away as views and ad-revenue fall. Scott predicted "difficult years" ahead given the rise of "junk zero-effort generative AI channels" and competing video options.[7][24][25]

On 6 January 2025, it was announced that Scott would be competing in Jet Lag: The Game Season 13: Schengen Showdown as a guest player. He would compete on the same team as Sam Denby against Adam Chase and Ben Doyle in racing to claim the most countries in Europe within six days.[26]</p>
